Hi, Iâ€™m @mgradwohl a Partner Group Engineering Manager working on Windows at Microsoft
- My team owns Task Manager, if you have bugs you want to report use the Feedback Hub

- Iâ€™m interested in WinUI 3 in C++ and C#, WIL, and the community toolkit
- I wish the community toolkit supported C++
- I'm porting VFI (Visual File Information) that I wrote in the late 90s early 2000s from MFC to WinUI3/Windows App SDK. Let me know if you want to collab.

- Iâ€™m currently learning Hawaiian on DuoLingo
- ðŸ“«@mgradwohl on Twitter (but I'm never there
- ðŸ“«@mgradwohl on Discord (I just got there)
- 
- Thoughts are my own, not the opinion of MSFT
