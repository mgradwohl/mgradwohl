Hi, Iâ€™m @mgradwohl a Partner Group Engineering Manager working on Windows at Microsoft
- My team owns Task Manager, if you have bugs you want to report use the Feedback Hub

- Iâ€™m interested in WinUI 3 in C++/WinRT, Win2D, Windows App SDK, and modern C++
- I'm writing ModernLife (https://github.com/mgradwohl/ModernLife) a cellular automata app in C++/WinRT, Win2D, Windows App SDK, and Modern C++ and open to collab
- I'm porting VFI (Visual File Information) that I wrote in the late 90s early 2000s from MFC to WinUI3/Windows App SDK.

- ðŸ“«@mgradwohl on Twitter (but I'm never there)
- ðŸ“«@mgradwohl on Discord (I just got there)
- ðŸ“«@matt@uppercutwoodworks on Slack [member ID U02T35QA5RP] (I just got there too)

- Thoughts are my own, not the opinion of MSFT
