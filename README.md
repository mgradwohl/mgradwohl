Hi, Iâ€™m @mgradwohl a retired/former Partner Group Engineering Manager working on Windows at Microsoft

- I'm going deep on Linux and VSCode
- I 3d print. A lot.
- Iâ€™m interested in WinUI 3 in C++/WinRT, Win2D, Windows App SDK, and modern C++
- I'm writing ModernLife (https://github.com/mgradwohl/ModernLife) a cellular automata app in C++/WinRT, Win2D, Windows App SDK, and Modern C++ and open to collab
- I'm porting VFI (Visual File Information) that I wrote in the late 90s early 2000s from MFC to WinUI3/Windows App SDK.

- ðŸ“«@mgradwohl on Discord (I just got there)
